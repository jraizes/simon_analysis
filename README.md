This project is for learning cryptanalysis by applying attacks to weakened versions of the Simon cipher.

Attacks Implemented:
- Linear Cryptanalysis
	- 2 round attack based on a 1 round characteristic, derived from scratch
	- 6 round attack based on a 3 round characteristic, derived from scratch
	- 6 round attack based on a 3 round characteristic, derived from scratch

- Differential Cryptanalysis
	- A 5 round attack based on a 3 round characteristic from **Differential cryptanalysis of round-reduced simon and
speck** by Abed et. al.
